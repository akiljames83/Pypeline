Description: # Pypeline
        This is a python library for easy implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms. In future iterations, this library will include plugins for Data Analysis and Machine Learning, specifically for data collection and manipulation.
        
        # Future Work
        On next iteration of pypeline, we plan on making an easy way to pass python data structures to files to be read for R reading and graphing.
